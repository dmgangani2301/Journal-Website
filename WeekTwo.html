        <h2>Creation of Objects in JavaScript and Presentation of HTML </h2>
        <p>During the second week of my learning journey, I was filled with excitement as I pursued a thorough understanding of the principal concepts of HTML and CSS. As I progressed, I gained a solid grasp of these two powerful tools and learned how to craft stunning websites using various selectors. By the end of the week, I felt confident in my ability to create a visually appealing website that accurately reflects my vision and goals. In the second week, I acquired a foundational understanding of SQL that has provided me with the skills and knowledge necessary to apply SQL principles to real-world scenarios.</p>
