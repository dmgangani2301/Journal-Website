        <h2>About Me</h2>
        
        <p>My name is Deepti. My educational background is Bachelor of Science in Physics which indicates that I have an interest in Maths and logic. Even with 12 years of customer service experience,I realized that I needed to learn a new skill set to move up the career ladder.
           Persuing degree is not enough in the current market. By enrolling in The Growth Company Bootcamp, I can explain how the Bootcamp helped fill my knowledge gaps and achieve a new sense of confidence with the help of great and intelligent tutors and the course materials.
           I am very new to the IT industry and started to learn HTML,CSS and JavaScript with The Growth Company Bootcamp. There is so much to learn via online platform with expertise of tutors, with lots of resources available. This journal gives you detailed information about 
           the Bootcamp and weekly progress of what are they doing each week. It will benefit all new learners who are willing to join the Bootcamp and gain knowledge. The Growth Company is one of the best online Bootcamp according to my knowldge and experience.
